# Wonders-of-the-World
My website gives a very brief history on the wonders of the world. It shows pictures and discusses the construction and purpose of the new 7 wonders of the world.

Requirements met:

1. Hamburger style collapsable menu that is fully displayed on desktop and collapses on mobile phones.
2. Used flexbox to rearrange content as the screen changes sizes.
3. Used media queries to switch from a two column layout to a one column layout on smaller screens.
4. I created a form (my contact area) that takes in atleast two fields of information and validates input. My email box requires the a@b.com format.
5. Used :nth child to target certain paragraphs on my webpage.
6. I created an image carousel with 7 images that rotate by clicking the arrows.
7. My nav bar is clickable to navigate to certain parts of the page - Not sure if this will count as an extra or not.

8. All of the mandatory requirements are also met.
